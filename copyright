  In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders give
  permission to link the code of portions of this program with the
  OpenSSL library under certain conditions as described in each
  individual source file, and distribute linked combinations
  including the two.
  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects
  for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.  If you modify
  file(s) with this exception, you may extend this exception to your
  version of the file(s), but you are not obligated to do so.  If you
  do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your
  version.  If you delete this exception statement from all source
  files in the program, then also delete it here.
 

 Certain source files in this program permit linking with the OpenSSL
 library (http://www.openssl.org), which otherwise wouldn't be allowed
 under the GPL.  For purposes of identifying OpenSSL, most source files
 giving this permission limit it to versions of OpenSSL having a license
 identical to that listed in this file (LICENSE.OpenSSL).  It is not
 necessary for the copyright years to match between this file and the
 OpenSSL version in question.  However, note that because this file is
 an extension of the license statements of these source files, this file
 may not be changed except with permission from all copyright holders
 of source files in this program which reference this file.
